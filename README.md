# Particle-Physics-vanilla-js-

This is a particle effect using only vanilla JavaScript which translates plain text into a mapped particle array with visual effects. The effect is similar to the constellation JS library.

This iteration utlizes fear/attraction on mouseover, which can be modified to your preferences by simply switching +/- on lines 60 and 61 in .js.

Works best with heavier, wider fonts, but making adjustments to code integer values (font size, radii, etc) can make most fonts legible. The effect can also be achieved with other high contrast images since they are easily mappable; a black/white image on transparent background should also work just as well.

This code was built utilizing [Frank's Labratory's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEqc149iR-ALYkGM6TG-7vQ) amazing youtube channel which focuses on pure html, css, and JS. Highly recommend if you are like me and like to learn the sorcery under the hood before snapping in a library!
